# Natural-Language-Processing
Approaches to solve Natural Language Processing tasks

Performs 
1. Preprocessing of Textual data 
2. Text Data Exploration through visualization 
3. Understanding Bigrams and Trigrams : Collocations
4. Use of pretrained word embeddings
5. Building text classifier with pretrained Glove embeddings using Keras
6. Build Text classifier with own embeddings trained using Keras
